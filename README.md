I'm Marius (also sometimes going by Layla)

I'm currently studying CS at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in Germany

I'm interested in (custom, ergonomic, mechanical) keybaords, the field of decision making and EE (which I have not yet had the chance to actually get into)

Sadly I'm not particularly skilled in any technologies (yet). I have the most experience in java though
